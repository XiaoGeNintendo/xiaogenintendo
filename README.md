### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is XGN. I am majoring _Information and Computational Science (Qiangji Class)_ at Nanjing University, China!

I am interested in game and software development and is currently doing personal projects for fun.

I could write a bit C++, Java, C# and Python, but my favorite language is Kotlin.
